# Code Quality Rules

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive variable names that explain purpose
- Avoid abbreviations except for common ones (e.g., `id`, `url`)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components, classes, and interfaces
- Use UPPERCASE for constants

## Component Structure
- Limit components to under 300 lines of code
- Extract repeated logic into shared utilities
- Keep component props simple and focused
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props

## Code Organization
- Group related imports together
- Order imports: external libraries first, then internal modules
- Place helper functions before the main component
- Structure function internals in a logical flow

## Comments and Documentation
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions and interfaces
- Keep comments updated when code changes
- Use TODO comments for planned improvements with ticket numbers

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement graceful degradation for failed network requests
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Formatting
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces recommended)
- Limit line length to 100 characters
- Use trailing commas in multiline object and array literals
- Add semicolons at the end of statements

## Best Practices
- Avoid magic numbers and strings
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Avoid side effects in pure functions
